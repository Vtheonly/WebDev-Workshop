### **1. Basic Calculator**

A **simple and interactive calculator** that allows users to perform **basic arithmetic operations** like:

- **Addition (+)**
- **Subtraction (-)**
- **Multiplication (*)**
- **Division (/)**

Users enter numbers, select an operation, and see the result instantly. The calculator will have a **clear button** to reset the inputs.

---

### **2. Image Slider**

A **basic image carousel** where users can:

- Click **"Next" or "Previous" buttons** to slide between images.
- View images **one at a time** with smooth transitions.
- Optionally, enable **automatic sliding** every few seconds.

This helps users **learn how to manipulate the DOM** and create animations in JavaScript.

---

### **3. Light/Dark Mode Toggle**

A **simple theme switcher** that lets users switch between:

- **Light mode** (white background, dark text)
- **Dark mode** (dark background, light text)

The mode is applied instantly when the user clicks the **toggle button**, and the website remembers their choice (using local storage).

---

### **4. Simple Password Generator**

A **random password generator** where users can customize:

- **Password length** (e.g., 8, 12, 16 characters)
- **Character types** (Numbers, lowercase, uppercase, symbols)
- **Difficulty level** (Easy, Medium, Hard)

When they click **"Generate"**, a random password appears with a **copy button** to copy it to the clipboard.

---

### **5. Login Page (Username & Password Validation in JS Array)**

A **basic login form** where:

- Users enter a **username and password**.
- The script **checks the credentials** against a predefined **array of users** in JavaScript.
- If correct, a **"Login Successful"** message appears; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

This helps beginners understand **form validation** in JavaScript.

---

### **6. To-Do List**

A **simple task manager** that allows users to:

- **Add new tasks** by typing and pressing enter.
- **Mark tasks as done** (checked tasks will have a **strikethrough effect**).
- **Delete tasks** when no longer needed.

This teaches **DOM manipulation and event handling** in JavaScript.

---

### **7. Unit Converter**

A **basic converter** with three sections:  
 **Currency Converter** – Converts **USD ↔ DZD, EUR ↔ DZD**.  
 **Temperature Converter** – Converts **Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit**.  
 **Measurement Converter** – Converts **Meters ↔ Feet, Kilograms ↔ Pounds, etc.**.

Users input a value, select a unit, and get the **converted result instantly**.

---

### **8. Word Counter**

A **real-time text analysis tool** that counts:

- **Words**
- **Characters**
- **Numbers**

It also has two sliders to:

- **Increase/decrease line spacing**.
- **Increase/decrease word spacing**.

Perfect for **learning how to handle text inputs dynamically**.

---

### **9. Progress Bar with Animation Controls**

A **customizable progress bar** where users can:

- Enter a **duration** (e.g., 10 seconds).
- Choose an **animation style**:
    - **Linear** (constant speed)
    - **Ease-in** (slow start, fast end)
    - **Ease-out** (fast start, slow end)
    - **Ease-in-out** (slow-fast-slow)
    - **Cubic** (smooth acceleration and deceleration)

The progress bar fills smoothly according to the selected style.
