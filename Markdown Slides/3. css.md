# 1. Introduction to CSS

-   **What is CSS?** Cascading Style Sheets. It controls the presentation of web pages (layout, colors, fonts).  Separates *content* (HTML) from *presentation* (CSS).
-   **How CSS Works with HTML:** CSS rules target HTML elements to style them.
- **Methods to Apply CSS:**

---

## Applying CSS: Inline

-   **Inline CSS:** Use the `style` attribute directly within HTML tags.
    ```html
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
    ```
    *   **Pros:** Quick changes, overrides other styles.
    *   **Cons:** Hard to maintain, not reusable, mixes content and presentation.  *Generally avoid for larger projects.*

---

## Applying CSS: Internal

-   **Internal CSS:** Use the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
    ```html
    <head>
      <style>
        p {
          color: green;
          font-size: 18px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    ```
    *   **Pros:** Good for single-page websites, overrides external styles.
    *   **Cons:** Not reusable across multiple pages.

---

## Applying CSS: External

-   **External CSS:** Create a separate `.css` file and link it to your HTML using the `<link>` tag.
    ```html
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```
    ```css
    /* styles.css */
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```
    *   **Pros:** Best for multi-page websites, clean separation of concerns, reusable, easier to maintain. *Recommended approach.*

---

# 2. CSS Selectors

-   Selectors define which HTML elements the CSS rules apply to.

---

## Basic Selectors

-   **Element Selector:** Targets elements by their tag name.
    ```css
    h1 {
      color: purple;
    } /* Styles all <h1> elements */
    ```
-   **Class Selector:** Targets elements with a specific class attribute.  Use a dot (`.`).
    ```css
    .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
    } /* Styles all elements with class="highlight" */
    ```
-   **ID Selector:** Targets a *single* element with a specific ID attribute.  Use a hash (`#`).  IDs should be unique on a page.
    ```css
    #main-header {
      font-size: 30px;
    } /* Styles the element with id="main-header" */
    ```

---

## Advanced Selectors: Grouping

-   **Grouping Selector:** Applies the same styles to multiple selectors.  Separate selectors with commas.
    ```css
    h1, h2, h3 {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    } /* Styles h1, h2, and h3 elements */
    ```

---

## Advanced Selectors: Descendant

-   **Descendant Selector:** Targets elements that are *descendants* of another element (not just direct children).  Use a space.
    ```css
    div p {
      color: gray;
    } /* Styles all <p> elements inside <div> elements */
    ```

---

## Advanced Selectors: Child

-   **Child Selector:** Targets elements that are *direct children* of another element.  Use a greater-than sign (`>`).
    ```css
    div > p {
      font-weight: bold;
    } /* Styles <p> elements that are direct children of <div> */
    ```

---

## Advanced Selectors: Attribute

-   **Attribute Selector:** Targets elements based on their attributes and attribute values.
    ```css
    input[type="text"] {
      border: 1px solid black;
    } /* Styles <input> elements with type="text" */
    ```

---

# 3. CSS Box Model

-   Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box.  The box model describes how the content, padding, border, and margin of an element are rendered.

---

## Box Model Components

-   **Content:** The actual content of the element (text, image, etc.).
-   **Padding:**  Space *inside* the element, between the content and the border.
-   **Border:**  A line that surrounds the padding and content.
-   **Margin:** Space *outside* the element, between the border and other elements.

---
## Box Model Example

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 30px;
}

```
* The content width is 200px
* 20px of the apdding
* The border 5px
*  the margin 30px.

---

# 4. CSS Units & Sizing

---

## Absolute Units

-   **px:** Pixels (most common absolute unit).  Fixed size.
- **cm:** Centimeters.
-   **mm:** Millimeters.
- *Note*: Absolute units don't scale well on different screen sizes.

---

## Relative Units

-   **%:** Percentage.  Relative to the parent element's size.
-   **em:** Relative to the font-size of the *element*.
-   **vw:** Viewport width (1vw = 1% of the viewport width).
- **vh:** Viewport height (1vh = 1% of the viewport height).
- *Note*: Relative units are crucial for creating responsive designs.

---

## Best Practices for Responsiveness

-   Use relative units (%) whenever possible for widths, heights, and spacing.
-   Use `em` or `rem` for font sizes.
- Use media queries (not covered here) to adjust styles for different screen sizes.

---

# 5. Colors & Backgrounds

---

## Defining Colors

-   **Named Colors:**  `red`, `blue`, `green`, `black`, etc. (limited set).
-   **RGB:**  `rgb(red, green, blue)`  Values from 0 to 255.
    ```css
    p {
      color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* Red */
    }
    ```

---

## Background Properties
- `background-color`: Sets the background color
- `background-image`: Use URL() TO Sets an image as the background:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("background.jpg");
}
```

-`background-size`: control the size of background
```css
div {
    background-size: cover; /*cover, contain, auto, a specific length, or percentages:*/
}
```

---

# 6. Text & Fonts

---

## Font Properties

-   `font-family`: Specifies the font.  Use fallback fonts.
    ```css
    p {
      font-family: "Arial", sans-serif; /* Arial, or any sans-serif if Arial isn't available */
    }
    ```
-   `font-size`: Sets the font size (use px, em, rem, etc.).
-   `font-weight`: Sets the boldness (normal, bold, 100-900).

---

## Text Alignment

-   `text-align`: Controls horizontal alignment:
    *   `left` (default)
    *   `right`
    *   `center`
    *   `justify` (stretches text to fill the line)

---

# 7. Positioning & Layouts

---

## Display Types

-   `display`: Controls how an element is displayed.
    *   `block`: Takes up the full width available, starts on a new line.  (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<form>`).
    *   `inline`: Takes up only as much width as necessary, does *not* start on a new line.  (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`).
    *   `inline-block`:  Like inline, but you *can* set width and height.

---
## Positioning: `static`
-**Static (default):** Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.

---
## Positioning: `relative`

-   **Relative:**  Positioned *relative to its normal position*.  Setting `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` properties will move it from its normal position. Other content will *not* adjust to fill the gap.

---

## Positioning: `absolute`

-   **Absolute:**  Positioned *relative to the nearest positioned ancestor* (an ancestor with `position` set to something other than `static`).  If there's no positioned ancestor, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<html>` element).  *Removed from the normal document flow* - other content will flow as if the absolutely positioned element isn't there.

---

## Positioning: `fixed`

-   **Fixed:**  Positioned *relative to the viewport* (the browser window).  It stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.  *Removed from the normal document flow*.

---

# 8. CSS Flexbox (Important for Layouts)

-   Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system (rows *or* columns).  Makes it easy to align and distribute space among items in a container.

---

## Flexbox Properties

-   `display: flex;`  Makes an element a flex container.  Its direct children become flex items.
-   `justify-content`: Aligns items *horizontally* within the container.
    *   `flex-start` (default): Items at the start.
    *   `flex-end`: Items at the end.
    *   `center`: Items centered.
    *   `space-between`: Space between items.
    *   `space-around`: Space around items.
    *   `space-evenly`: equal between and around

---

-   `align-items`: Aligns items *vertically* within the container.
    *   `stretch` (default): Items stretch to fill the container.
    *   `flex-start`: Items at the top.
    *   `flex-end`: Items at the bottom.
    *   `center`: Items centered.
    *   `baseline`: Items aligned by their baselines.
-    `flex-wrap` :Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
    *  `nowrap`
    *   `wrap`
    *    `wrap-reverse`
-   `flex-grow`: Specifies how much the item will grow relative to the rest

---



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px; /* Just for demonstration */
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.flex-item {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">3</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

---

# 9. CSS Grid (For Advanced Layouts)

CSS Grid is another powerful layout system, but it's two-dimensional (rows *and* columns). It's excellent for creating complex layouts, but it has a steeper learning curve than Flexbox.  You should learn it later on your own as you progress in your web development journey. It's a very important tool, but for now, focus on the fundamentals.

---

# 10. Transitions

-   `transition`: Creates smooth animations between different states of an element (e.g., on hover).
    ```css
    button {
      background-color: blue;
      color: white;
      transition: background-color 0.3s ease; /* Smoothly change background-color over 0.3 seconds */
    }

    button:hover {
      background-color: darkblue;
    }
    ```
    *   Property: The CSS property to transition (e.g., `background-color`, `width`, `opacity`).
    *   Duration: How long the transition should take (e.g., `0.3s`, `1s`).
    *    Timing Function: The speed curve of the transition (`ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`).
