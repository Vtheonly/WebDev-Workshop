# Recap: What We've Learned

We've covered the fundamentals of web development:

-   **CSS:** Styling and presentation (selectors, box model, properties, values).
-   **JavaScript:** Interactivity and dynamic behavior (variables, functions, DOM manipulation, events).

## Connecting the Pieces

-   **HTML** provides the building blocks.
-   **CSS** makes it look good.
-   **JavaScript** makes it do things.

These three technologies work together to create modern web pages and applications.
